Project Overview: Mitron Bank Credit Card Analysis

Objective:
The project, commissioned by CodeBasis, focused on providing valuable insights for Mitron Bank to facilitate the introduction of a new line of credit cards. The primary goal was to broaden Mitron Bank's product offerings and enhance its market reach in the financial sector.

Approach:
To achieve the project objectives, a comprehensive dashboard was developed to analyze key aspects of customer spending behavior. The following key components were addressed:

Income Analysis by City:

The dashboard provides a detailed breakdown of income distribution across different cities. This analysis aids Mitron Bank in understanding the economic landscape and potential customer segments in various locations.
Spend Analysis by City:

Detailed insights into spending patterns across cities were incorporated, helping Mitron Bank identify regions with higher consumer spending. This information is crucial for targeting marketing efforts and tailoring credit card offerings to meet local needs.
Spend Analysis by Mode of Payment:

The dashboard includes a comprehensive breakdown of spending based on different payment modes. This insight is valuable for understanding customer preferences and optimizing credit card features to align with preferred payment methods.
Spend Analysis by Category:

A detailed breakdown of spending across various categories, such as travel, shopping, dining, and more, was conducted. This information guides Mitron Bank in designing credit card benefits that align with popular spending categories.
Monthly Spending Trends:

The analysis includes a month-wise breakdown of spending to identify trends and peak spending periods. This information is instrumental in designing promotions and rewards aligned with specific months.
Age Group Spending Analysis:

Insights into spending behavior based on different age groups were explored. This data aids Mitron Bank in tailoring credit card features and marketing strategies to match the preferences of specific age demographics.
Gender-based Spending Patterns:

The analysis delves into gender-specific spending patterns, providing Mitron Bank with valuable information to create gender-tailored credit card offerings and marketing campaigns.
Occupation-based Spending and Earnings:

The dashboard incorporates an analysis of spending and earnings based on different occupations. This information is crucial for customizing credit card features that cater to the financial needs of specific professional groups.
Outcome:
The resulting dashboard offers Mitron Bank a holistic view of customer behavior, enabling data-driven decision-making for the introduction of the new line of credit cards. The insights gained from the analysis support strategic planning, product customization, and targeted marketing efforts to enhance Mitron Bank's position in the competitive financial market.
